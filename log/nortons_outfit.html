<h1>Bringing Norton To Life + Accuracy Notes</h1>

<h3>The Original, As Seen In The Game</h3>

<h3>The Helmet</h3>
<p>Due to the official promotional art of Norton as well as his stageplay costume, most fans believe his helmet is made of metal but it's probably more likely to be coated canvas or leather. Personally I think it looks metallic due zinc and lead dust coating over it as a packed layer that makes it so reflective. Because of this common misconception amongst the fandom, I actually made two helmets.</p>

<p>The one on the right is the helmet I modeled after his ingame ragdoll form, featuring the "staple" seams on the joints of the helmet. It's a little more faithful to the stageplay costume hat than the new one. I realized I prefer my cosplay to be more on the realistic side, so it's since been sold off.</p>
<p>In his first appearance in Ashes Of Memory Norton's helmet appears on the table of the manor's dining hall with leather stitching rather than weld seams like I initially thought they were. At least it's more comfortable to wear than metal, though I like metal helmet Norton just as fine.</p>

<p>It's entirely made of eva foam, and the seams are dremeled down then slathered in mod podge. My last edit to the helmet is a flat extrusion where the stitching should be, and I drilled several more holes to insert the shoelace into (sourced from IRL store).</p>
<h3>The Scarf</h3>
<p>Norton wears a white scarf, arguably a bold color to sport in the deeper dirts. It's been dirtied from years of wear so it appears yellow in most renders and artwork, and the same color as his helmet's candle. I didn't feel like sewing, so I opted to cut out a strip of thick flannel.</p>

<p>Flannel has a stiff structure and feels comfortable around your neck, whereas some other cotton constructions aren't. The edges are also brushed with eyeshadow then finished with Got2b Glued Hairspray. It stays the same shape throughout most of my pictures.</p>
<h3>The Compass</h3>
<p>Though never stated, I think the closest model is a Verner's 1918's Prismatic Marching Compass. These compasses are made of brass and used for mapping routes, typically used on a tripod.</p>

<p>While his compass model is available on the secondhand market, I modeled and printed a functional, hinged compass prop based off of it. If you want a lightweight compass replica like this for your Norton Campbell costume, you're free to <a href="mailto:0ekekddddd@protonmail.com">e-mail me</a> to place a commission.</p>
