      <title>2025.04.06 // quitter's park: twitch stream</title>
      <pubDate>Sun, 6 Apr 2025 02:35:21 -0500</pubDate>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>I've been silent streaming on Twitch and it's been a very repairing experience to directly chat with followers and friends. Although they come and go in small numbers with large periods of silence inbetween, I get to host a space where I can share my music tastes and I've merged a little closer into my established community.</p>
<p>I whipped up an <a href="https://gristlepod.github.io/stream/" target="_parent">onsite mount</a>  to watch my streams from. Drop by 2pm - 4am CST and chat with me.</p>]]></description>

      <title>2025.02.19 // luchino fansite update</title>
      <pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 11:02:36 -0600</pubDate>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>The Luchino fansite should be bracing a new layout theme along with new subsections, "Music Playlist," and "Merchandise I Collected." They pretty much explain themselves; just expect them to be updated for as long as I upkeep the site. I've taken a liking to writing in my free time when I'm spending time with my girlfriend or not overhauling other dev projects, so chances are a "Fanfiction" tab will&nbsp;make its way in.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>site changes are officially being recorded... i might have waited too long to do this ever since the host switch. a brand new sitewide layout graphic has been applied for the special occasion, but i'll keep using the old one for the blog. regarding ko-fi i've come across issues with overseas sales, so i'll issue a list of countries i can't ship to internationally in the upcoming commission TOS.</p>]]></description>
