    document.getElementById("display").innerHTML = "<h4 id='whoIsLuchino'>&rarr; Who is Luchino?</h4><div><p>Luchino Diruse is a playable character from a Dead-By-Daylight style game called Identity V. He was introduced in Season 6 of the game's running time and just like how DBD is split into killer/survivor sides, Luchino has two playstyles in both IDV's hunter and survivor factions.</p><p>Luchino's fate is what happens when science guides itself into the fog without ethic. He worked as a herpetologist alongside a university prior to his arrival to <a href='https://id5.fandom.com/wiki/Oletus_Manor' target='_blank'>Oletus</a> and is recognized in group 6, denoted by his <a href='https://id5.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Letters' target='_blank'>third character letter</a>'s confirmed serial &quot;6-1-4&quot;. He was known to test reptile bites on himself as his field was venom logic and would experience his very own genetic metamorphosis when given captivity of an unknown lizard-snake species. Some might say this was doomed kismet, but Luchino himself would go on to describe this transformation as a gift, or the &quot;presents from his research&quot;.</p></div><h4>&rarr; His Personality</h4><div class='rightbox'><p>He is described by <a href='https://id5.fandom.com/wiki/Novelist' target='_blank'>the writer of the Character Letters</a> to be &quot;curious, cautious, envious, melancholic.&quot; Luchino is intuitive, bearing in mind other people's intentions before he makes decisions, but composes himself politely when he speaks unopposed to the idea of working with suspicious people when it means furthering his studies. While he can be blunt, precise, and practical-minded, he is humble and realistic, understanding the limit of his abilties.</p><p>Luchino seems to embrace the final stages of his transformation. His <a href='https://id5.fandom.com/wiki/Curiosity_(Emote)' target='_blank'>Character Day emote</a> tributes to his past how he remembers working as an academic professor, literally laughing at his naiveté and others who are like his younger self. This emote also sort of reflects his dark humor. In his last Character Day letter, he expresses enlightment that he no longer cares to persevere in the name of his research. It's not that he doesn't care anymore, but accepts that not everything can be understood by a mere man, and takes conclusion to his research in one last diary at the manor. He begins pursuit of his spirituality as he realizes the (Lovecraftian) nonreality of Oletus.</p><center class='quote'>&quot;And I finally understand that those researchers who regret failing to find the answer are laughable. After all, there was never a true 'answer' in this world.&quot;<br>- IDV's &quot;The Last Page of a Record&quot; (2023)</center><p>His settling mutation has rendered him something self-pleasuring and aggressive towards other people. His humor and sadistic tendencies carry into his (non-canon) online interactions and event dialogues, as he expresses an interest in plant toxins, chasing prey (sort of like a dog...) and unethical experimentation. He is long separated from the professor he once was, but he seems happier than when he was human.</p></div><table id='menu'><tr><td style='width:50%;'><center class='quote'>くく…まだそれを…ははは！<br>問うな…人間風情が…<br>私は究極…究極だ…くひひ…<br>お前を喰らいて…究極と化す…<br>その血肉を…きひひゃひゃ！<br>極限の未知の先に辿り着いた、私を、<br>満たす…満たす…満た…………<br>クギ……カ………ひひひ……<br>なぁ…もう良いだろう？<br>▽┰▽＜渇いて…仕方ないんだ…</center></td><td><center class='quote'>Hehe... still that... hahaha!<br>Don't ask... humanity is...<br>I am the ultimate... the ultimate... heehee...<br>I will devour you... and become the ultimate...<br>That flesh and blood... kihihyahya!<br>I have reached the limit of the unknown.<br>Fill... fill... fill... fill.........<br>Nail.... click.... heeheehee...<br>Hey... isn't that enough now?<br>▽┰▽＜ I'm thirsty...

    document.getElementById("display").innerHTML = "<h4>&rarr; Detailing Luchino's Mutations</h4><div><p>Not to the fault of most IDV fans since it's a common misconception, but Luchino's mutations are not representative of evolution even if he says it is. Maybe in the context of Pokémon it would be, but evolution is nothing but the natural offset of generational traits rather than a person-by-person reaction, and no amount of external stimuli or transformative venom juice will make what Luchino went through evolution. Even in context of evolution, evolution never looks back.</p><center class='quote'>[Retrieving quote, come back later. I just don't want to buy the book].</center><p>As much as I like the Ouroboros motifs of Luchino's tale, I like to think that because evolution has no memory or foresight Luchino is essentially a separate classification beyond human or reptile. He does have countless similarities of a reptile &mdash; the extra jawbone in his mouth and the scaled composition of his skin most notably &mdash; but he's probably more closely related to the biped avemetatarsalia (or something close). A parallel creature outside of the more relevant, modern, reptile. A &quot;negative dinosaur&quot;. And I use &quot;related&quot; loosely.</p></div><h4>&rarr; Foresight</h4><div><p>Even though the contexts of evolution don't correctly describe Luchino's metamorphosis, Luchino technically <i>has</i> made it to &quot;the next step&quot; in a series of undiscovered evolutionary staircases as we peek into the genetic potential of whatever-he-is. We don't even know much about the origins of the lizard-snake thing Luchino had been studying to even classify it as either or, so as far as I'm concerned it's &quot;like&quot; a reptile, but has zero ties to any Earthly reptile.</p><p>One of my favorite anatomical features about Luchino is definitely his digitigrade hindlegs. When I first saw them in-game, I just sort of found them out of place &mdash; offputting but attractive, establishing a kind of disconnect from true reptile anatomy and I chalked it off as an oversight by Netease. Most modern reptiles are plantigrade like bears and humans, but his legs are bird-like where he has a third segment of leg that he stands on rather than his whole sole touching the floor.</p><p>I probably would've accepted either approach because some of the best fantastical designs stray away from anatomical accuracy and just work because they look cool. To my thrill his deduction quests and Character Day letters intentionally make the origins of the his reptile specimen obscure, describing it as both a snake and a lizard in multiple instances. It's actually a great testament of Luchino's themes of ambiguity.</p></div>";

    document.getElementById("display").innerHTML = "<h4>&rarr; Themes of Ambiguity: Alternate Identity System</h4><div><p>To the Identity V players who haven't picked up the game since the last Case Closed Crossover, the game had a 2.0 update and room for a replacement protagonist was made, Alice Deross (The Journalist). Following her debut the game introduced the idea of &quot;<a href=&quot;https://id5.fandom.com/wiki/Alternate_Identities&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>Alternate Identities</a>.&quot;</p><p>Tldr; a character (survivor or a hunter) whose already a playable character can be reintroduced as a whole new playable unit with a completely different kit and playstyle from their original counterpart. The selling point is that this was multi-factional. Norton, Orpheus, Joker, Luchino, Alice, and Mike... and the like have alternate identities in all different factions. In the future, there's always going to be more of these alternate identities for as long as Identity V's servers keep running.</p><p>There was a split in the community on whether or not this mechanic was being handled to its potential. In 2024, 3 out of 6 of the characters with confirmed alternate identities only had been presented in dramatic sequences as their hunter forms when everyone's explicitly doped up on Orpheus's drugs.</p></div><h4>&rarr; Ashes of Memory II Changed The System</h4><div><p>... For the worst? This &quot;The monsters were actually hallucinations&quot; thing felt lazy on Netease's end. I could've accepted this reveal once in AOM I, but twice is pushing it.</p><p>To better gauge the significance of this system, Identity V announces around 6 new characters a year, though the frequency of upcoming character content has slowed down with time. With this new system in order, some SNS character introductions double as an identity switch, and their ingame debuts have all been followed with a fully-animated, cutscene-packed event for their respective lore. Players wait maybe a year or two for established lore to get expanded on. That's fine, that's what we signed up for.</p><p>What disappointed me was how little of the internal politics and relationships that occured during or before &quot;AOM II&quot; was shown. It was one of the weaker storyline updates to follow Norton's identity switch (&quot;Fool's Gold&quot;). From Alice's perspective we were able to get an air of tense familiarity with all the guests in her game, but that was something we already knew from the letters. The development between <a href='https://id5.fandom.com/wiki/Time_of_Reunion' target='_blank'>Time of Reunion</a> and &quot;Ashes of Memory I&quot; felt delayed by the bloat of Ashes of Memory II. The cherry on top? &quot;The monsters were actually hallucinations.&quot;</p><p>Hullabaloo's storyline event exceled where TOR/AOM didn't while also presenting Joker (and Mike for like 4 seconds) as hallucinated monsters, so I do have hope that where the system lacks the story makes up for. Again, TOR/AOM was the very last recorded game that occured at Oletus, so the developers have incentive to milk the AOM cast's likeness without having much to say.</p><p>I don't hate AOM/TOR. It's not completely devoid of new information &mdash; we learned the origin of Mary's ghost, Melly &amp; Frederick's grounds to attend the manor game, and the Norton fans got a stupid bread scene that IDV Tw*tter couldn't put down. I'm upset that it shot my favorite mystery's foot. It's very likely that when TOR/AOM's storyline wraps up, it'll all be as satisfying as Hullabaloo's sequence.</p><p>One of Identity V's strongest points is its ambiguity and openendedness for the same reasons we might enjoy mythology or cryptic beasts. The franchise <b>does</b> take advantage of this using Lovecraftian frameworks, its why they're able to milk their characters every year so that they don't have to write the story in one sitting.</p><p>When thinking why the two player factions exist (outside of their roots to DBD's format), it makes you think about why some hunters earned their fate as hunters, and what separates them from the survivors who themselves committed many if not more moral injuries than the hunters. I was pretty disappointed that with the alternate identity system, the developers started its early order by chalking it up to the cousin of &quot;it was all just a dream&quot; when they've already struck gold retaining the mystery of what hunters are.</p><p>This is why Luchino is the alternate identity system's saving grace by tapping into the ambiguity of Identity V.</p></div><h4>&rarr; The Vague Nature of Luchino</h4><div><p>Considering his plot, nobody really knows whether or not we are interpreting Reptilian Luchino as we see it, or if we can really chalk it up to just drugs. Luchino's survivor form (professor) is visibly growing scales and his arms bleed when they fall off. As far as we know, Professor is real and in front of us, the point of reference. Evil Reptilian is who we want to be.</p><p>Apparently Professor Luchino was confirmed 30 in the Character Relations tab while Reptilian Luchino was confirmed 35 in the official artbook (and later changed to have an undecided age). It's completely feasible for Luchino to have actually transformed to the final stage of &quot;full reptile&quot; between his first and second game. The trick here is that they don't lift the curtain and explain who Evil Reptilian is to the rest of the cast.</p><p>I'd prefer the hunter dynamics to be obscured permanently in the narrative rather than every game having been revealed as a drug plot back to back.</p></div>";

After jumping, he pants in <a href='https://youtube.com/shorts/vCdFTjDBDho?si=l8luvSFQD-dTHGEa' target='_blank'>the same way horses with this condition do</a>.

Mid-transformation, all the bits recede internally and it's not that different from a hairless marsupial's cloaca.

They're so small that you can't see the individual scutes and too thin and soft to have yet developed his infamous teal color, but it gives him a glossy look.</li><ul><li>As this film becomes thicker towards the final stage of his metamorphosis, shedding becomes more painful. Like tearing a 2-4mm deep scab off your entire body. It's a bloody process, but natural.</li></ul><li>In the mid-late stages of his metamorphosis, his human hair completely sheds and is gradually replaced with a scalp of scale pillars, similar to the hairs on a gecko's feet or the &quot;hairs&quot; on a bug's exoskeleton.</li></ul></div>";

Luchino and Norton were the wheelhorses of their fields so obsessed in their goals that they've broken some sort of ethical boundary to achieve it. Norton eventually blew up a  <a href='https://id5.fandom.com/wiki/Golden_Cave' target='_blank'>mountain</a> before fleeing off-the-grid for prospecting work, and Luchino was taken advantage of as he self-experimented venom samples. Their work also leads them into an affinity with the trascendent, grotesque creatures they cross roads with.</p><p>Inevitably they've been marked by Gla'aki &amp; Yidhra respectively and transform beyond human identity in their own ways (or at least are outcasted by those around them in some way). Their different approaches to transformation and their individual desires make them a compatible, suited, pair if hypothetically to meet.</p><p>Norton is the preservation to Luchino's self harm, and Luchino is the apathetically humorous to Norton's ticking intensity.</p></div><h4>&rarr; Ties In Lovecraft</h4><div><p style='color:#00000070;'>Disclaimer: Identity V lore is designed to be undefined and vague. While I share most of fan loric consensus, I have some of my own invented interpretations in the following section.</p><p>Luchino's tale is somewhat of a transhumanist one. The specimen his <a href='https://id5.fandom.com/wiki/Dr._Duquein_Thompson' target='_blank'>coworker</a> gives him comes from a deity <a href='https://id5.fandom.com/wiki/Dream_Witch' target='_blank'>Yidhra</a>, one of the cryptic beasts I was referring to in &quot;Themes of Ambiguity&quot; and shares the name of another <a href='https://lovecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Yidhra' target='_blank'>Yidhra</a>. While not directly involved with the manor and her goals aren't stressed, she's moreso a metaphysical force of nature and &quot;high stakes pest&quot; that <a href='https://id5.fandom.com/wiki/Lakeside_Village' target='_blank'>eventually crosses the manor</a>. Not much is known about the entire collective of Yidhra's metamorphosis's effects, but I like to think Luchino's transformation progresses on the same rate as Norton's.</p><p>When Luchino writes about his developing insanity and turning unhuman &mdash; post-human. He writes about having came to terms with his human ignorance knowing that he won't ever understand &quot;all the answers&quot; and gives up the endless search for &quot;Point B&quot; of science or life. Instead, he pursues pleasure in his new body where he can define the final destination of his experiments and accept complacency, where science couldn't. Before he can even grow his tail he's already accepted the life of a cold, natural predator.</p><p>Norton also has history with another <a href='https://lovecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Glaaki' target='_blank'>otherworldly force named Gla'aki</a> (this time, it is literally Gla'aki). Unlike Luchino, it didn't take long for him to accept that his curse would change his chances of freedom. Norton even sought after his curse and since remained loyal to his original goals, not experiencing the green decay (until decades later into the future according to HP). Where Luchino's curse ended his career, Norton found his.</p></div><h4>&rarr; Their Dynamic</h4><div><p>Luchino spent his life in observation and Norton never had family or friends to humor his problems. Despite them both being introverted and self-sustaining, they learn for the love of it. They may touch base about each other's fields of work as they both envy the fruit of knowledge and that want to learn would keep their bond fresh for years.</p><p><img src='images/notoruki_portrait.png' alt='A Luchino x Norton sketch I drew.' title='Aren&#39;t they cute?' style='float:right;padding:2px;'>Luchino and Norton would keep each other at armslength when first meeting, but eventually develop a long term friendship and bond over that which they can't reach but adore, like the stars that represents Norton's freedom and Luchino's knowledge. I can imagine them having a late-night whiskey next to a banker's lamp. The night tells the time Norton found pockets of a rare type of salt after a cave flood and Luchino tells his field travels in India. When Luchino asks Norton if he's ever traveled overseas, Norton tells him he's never made it out of Britain outside of when he was contracted to another site on the margin. Maybe Luchino would encourage him to apply to the sciences; you can't see the stars from under the tunnels your entire life after all.</p><p>There's also just something melancholic about two servants of greater forces finding comfort in each other because they're the only ones who'll have remembered and seen each other before Yidhra's transformation and the <a href='https://lovecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Servant_of_Glaaki' target='_blank'>Green Decay</a>. It makes you wonder what'd they'd do to support each other from their godly abductors, or how they'd feel if they failed to help at all. What if they both watched each other become something else over time; would Norton find solidarity in his soulmate's reptilian skin, as firm as his burns? Would Luchino mourn Norton succumbing to the green decay's zombification? Does Norton envy the academic life Luchino was gifted?</p></div><h4>&rarr; Community Reception</h4><div><p>In earlier seasons it was controversial to romantically pair hunters with survivors. Luchino x Norton would've been considered a toxic/problematic ship alongside <a href='https://shipping.fandom.com/wiki/JosCarl' target='_blank'>others</a> likely because of literal interpretations of ingame matches where a hunter can <a href='images/jeffthekillyou.jpeg' target='_blank'>jeff the kill you</a> and send you on a coaster-ride abomination that either sends you back to the manor or explodes upon impact, or because Luchino is unhuman. As Identity V became populated with newer/younger generations of players Luchinort media isn't nearly as popular today as it was before. With the introduction to &quot;alternate identities,&quot; people are a lot more accepting of these types of dynamics since a hunter can also be a survivor at the same time.</p></div>";
