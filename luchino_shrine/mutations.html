	  <h4>&rarr; Detailing Luchino's Mutations</h4>
	  <div>
	    <p>Not to the fault of most IDV fans since it's a common misconception, but Luchino's mutations are not representative of evolution even if he says it is. Maybe in the context of Pok√©mon it would be, but evolution is nothing but the natural offset of generational traits rather than a person-by-person reaction, and no amount of external stimuli or transformative venom juice will make what Luchino went through evolution. Even in context of evolution, evolution never looks back.</p>

		<p>As much as I like the Ouroboros motifs of Luchino's tale, I like to think that because evolution has no memory or foresight Luchino is essentially a separate classification beyond human or reptile. He does have countless similarities of a reptile &mdash; the extra jawbone in his mouth and the scaled composition of his skin most notably &mdash; but he's probably more closely related to the biped avemetatarsalia (or something close). A parallel creature outside of the more relevant, modern, reptile. A &quot;negative dinosaur&quot;. And I use &quot;related&quot; loosely.</p>

	  <h4>&rarr; Foresight</h4>
	  <div>
	    <p>Even though the contexts of evolution don't correctly describe Luchino's metamorphosis, Luchino technically <i>has</i> made it to &quot;the next step&quot; in a series of undiscovered evolutionary staircases as we peek into the genetic potential of whatever-he-is. We don't even know much about the origins of the lizard-snake thing Luchino had been studying to even classify it as either or, so as far as I'm concerned it's &quot;like&quot; a reptile, but has zero ties to any Earthly reptile.</p>
		<p>One of my favorite anatomical features about Luchino is definitely his digitigrade hindlegs. When I first saw them in-game, I just sort of found them out of place &mdash; offputting but attractive, establishing a kind of disconnect from true reptile anatomy and I chalked it off as an oversight by Netease. Most modern reptiles are plantigrade like bears and humans, but his legs are bird-like where he has a third segment of leg that he stands on rather than his whole sole touching the floor.</p>
		<p>I probably would've accepted either approach because some of the best fantastical designs stray away from anatomical accuracy and just work because they look cool. To my thrill his deduction quests and Character Day letters intentionally make the origins of the his reptile specimen obscure, describing it as both a snake and a lizard in multiple instances. It's actually a great testament of Luchino's themes of ambiguity.</p>
