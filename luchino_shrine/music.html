	  <h4><a onclick='changeAudio(0)'>▶ Tim Exile - Sliiime</a></h4>
	  <p>An <a href='https://youtu.be/0iSWk8Tza14?si=rtg-sBJPkc1sNZo8' target='_blank'>abstract IDM track from Tim Exile's &quot;Pro Agonist&quot;</a> (18+). Just when you thought you could identify a word of English, its already molted into some un-human buzzing synth with each acoustic pluck. It's one of my favorite songs that only my favorite characters have the honor of holding as an &quot;anthem&quot;.<p>

	  <p><a href='https://id5.fandom.com/wiki/Emergency_Transport?file=EmergencyTransportPress.gif' target='_blank'>Emergency Transport</a> was sent to scavenge the metropolis while the rest of the squad is held back at the research quarters. He passes the time <a href='https://anklepants.bandcamp.com/track/preset-of-the-radical-sydney-dubstepfad' target='_blank'>salvaging signals on his ham radio</a> while hauling back spare tires.</p>

	  <p>The transmissions grew erratic the deeper Emergency Transport walked into the sporic nest. He hugs his radio's earpiece reluctantly to his ear awaiting the next order, but <a href='https://warprecords.bandcamp.com/track/listening-tree' target='_blank'>the cycling melodies suddenly grew rhythmic</a>. His transmissions promised fresh air to wastelands which hasn't seen green grass in forever; the oddest part was how convincing it all sounded.</p>
