		<ul>
		  <li>Luchino is a gay man raised Catholic (non-practicing).</li>
		    <ul>
			  <li>Fun fact: <a href='https://twitter.com/Kenzyko_eja9'>Luchino's stageplay actor</a> is openly gay.</li>
			</ul>
		  <li>He got ready in the morning slicking his hair back when he was working as a researcher. He began braiding his hair over the baldspots where his horns would emerge, until he decided to braid it at the ends to keep it out of the way when <a href='https://id5.fandom.com/wiki/Evil_Reptilian#External_Traits_&_Abilities'>jumping and hunting</a> and the horns couldn't be covered anymore. </li>
		  <li>Pre-transformation Luchino has both lobes pierced, but can no longer wear ear jewelry post-transformation. He does pierce his own tongue sheath though.</li>
		  <li>Since Luchino was only reported missing, he's probably still alive and squatting in the non-occupied cabin in Darkwoods that Bane Perez used to rest in.</li>
		    <ul>
			  <li>This is my way of shoehorning him into AOM and making Luchino x Norton work. After Norton retreats from his assassination attempt in Darkwoods, he stays in hiding at the hunting cabin and <strike>gets assaulted</strike> meets Luchino there, the legend'd reptilian of Britain.</li>
			  <li>Yidhra also appears at the bonfire if you chair 3 survivors, so this conveniently (but barely) ties Luchino into this map for me.</li>
			</ul>
		  <li>Given that Luchino has the quadratojugal bone that allows reptiles, birds, and amphibians to dislocate their jaws, Luchino's teeth are exclusively for gripping and killing. He also can't chew given that he lost his molars, and instead swallows bodies whole.</li>
		    <ul>
		      <li>The range of large animals he can swallow whole are pigs, goats, and deers.</li>
		      <li>Luchino has trouble breathing while jumping around. When reaching the stage where his neck had transformed into a thicker trunk, he experimented a lot with the limits of what he can swallow resulting in laryngeal neuropathy. After jumping, he pants in <a href='https://youtube.com/shorts/vCdFTjDBDho?si=l8luvSFQD-dTHGEa' target='_blank'>the same way horses with this condition do</a>. These are the internal tradeoffs that come with &quot;evolution&quot;.</li>
		    </ul>
		  <li>Poor eyesight, but he develops odor receptors on his tongue within mid-stage metamorphosis and scent becomes his primary form of navigating the game stages.</li>
		  <li>Luchino developed an asymmetrical tine on his tongue and a tail that can't fall off but regenerates if ever cut.</li><li>Luchino has a cloaca. Mid-transformation, all the bits recede internally and it's not that different from a hairless marsupial's cloaca. I imagine your junk growing scales and turning inside out is terrifying to see though.</li>
		  <li>In his early-stage transformations, he develops a microscale film all over his body. They're so small that you can't see the individual scutes and too thin and soft to have yet developed his infamous teal color, but it gives him a glossy look.</li>
		    <ul>
		      <li>As this film becomes thicker towards the final stage of his metamorphosis, shedding becomes more painful. Like tearing a 2-4mm deep scab off your entire body. It's a bloody process, but natural.</li>
		    </ul>
		  <li>In the mid-late stages of his metamorphosis, his human hair completely sheds and is gradually replaced with a scalp of scale pillars, similar to the hairs on a gecko's feet or the &quot;hairs&quot; on a bug's exoskeleton.</li>
		</ul>
