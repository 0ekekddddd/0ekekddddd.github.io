        <p><a href="https://id5.fandom.com/wiki/Journalist" target="_blank">Reporter</a>'s Log: The "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irvine,_North_Ayrshire" target="_blank">Irvine</a> Basilisk" is a 1900's modern rumor (often compared to the similarly adored <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loch_Ness_Monster" target="_blank">Nessie</a>). Major testimonies claim it traversing the borders of <a href="https://id5.fandom.com/wiki/Lakeside_Village">the derelicts</a>. <strike>Woodland sites too dense</strike> Last witness report at Kilmarnock quarry.</p>

	  <h4>Personality</h4>
	  <div>
	    <p>[Pre-transformation] Luchino is intuitive, constantly searching for people's intentions with him before he makes decisions, but composes himself politely when he speaks&mdash; unopposed to the idea of working with suspicious people when it means furthering his studies. While he can be blunt, precise, and practical-minded, he is humble and realistic, understanding the limit of his abilties.</p>
		<p>[Post-transformation] His settling mutation has rendered him something self-pleasuring and aggressive towards other people. His humor and sadistic tendencies carry into his (non-canon) online interactions and event dialogues, as he expresses an interest in plant toxins, chasing prey (sort of like a dog...) and unethical experimentation. He is long separated from the professor he once was, but he seems happier than when he was human.</p>
		<p>(Read more: <a href="whoisluchino.html">Who Is Luchino?</a>)</p>
		<p>Professor likes savory herbivore foods like artichoke soup and cantaloupe. After his lunch, he tries to make room in his schedule to roll his trousers up and dip his ankles into a body of water before returning to his research. Reptilian enjoys swallowing just about anything he can hunt, as without taste only the spoils of a hunt appeal his instincts. When he starts, he can't stop hunting. Most importantly, Luchino Diruse secretly likes the idea of being in control.</p>
	  </div>
	  <h4>In-game Match Style</h4>
	  <div>
	    <p>(This section is based on the laws of the <a href="https://id5.fandom.com/wiki/Identity_V_Stage_Play" target="_blank">stageplay</a>'s universe.)</p>
	    <p>As a survivor, Luchino tries not to get in the way of his teammates and expects to only speak with them when they call for his help or ask him for directions. He takes initiative in being human-shield, and sometimes jumps into chase too early after he's finished working on a cipher (it's like clockwork.) </p>
		<p>While his communication is lacking, he has a great sixth sense of where he should and will be needed when he has to takeover. Sometimes he hugs walls traversing to different areas and ends up scaring his own teammates because of his radio-silence (he literally forgets to use the quick-message radio that the manor provides each participant.)</p>
		<p>He prefers to decode alone and becomes absent-minded when he's expected to take lead of a cipher problem, but is great at backseating.</p>
		<p>Although most of the game participants are friendly or political with him, some gossip about his strange insistence to sacrifice himself in the face of danger with each match even when the kiters have it under control. What are these projects involving the hunter that the professor chooses to keep under wraps? Speaking of wraps, what's that growing teal beneath his gauze...?</p>
		<p>As a hunter, Luchino plays with his food and makes it clear to the survivor team what's to come if they slip up once. A <a href="https://id5.fandom.com/wiki/Peeper">peeper</a>-whisperer and is notorious for playing unfair (something he's picked up on during his professional career.) Even the hunters kind of dislike <a href="https://id5.fandom.com/wiki/Duo_Hunters" target="_blank">playing with him</a> due to his habit of stealing prey.</p>
		<p>He takes the manor's immortality laws to an extreme, often whittling his chaired victims as a show of territory using his trusty kukri.</p>

	  <h4>Headcanons (18+)</h4>

	    <p>Content warning for slightly explicit biology talk.</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Luchino was raised Catholic (non-practicing).</li>
		  <li>He got ready in the morning slicking his hair back when he was working as a researcher. He began braiding his hair over the baldspots where his horns would emerge, until he decided to braid it at the ends to keep it out of the way when <a href='https://id5.fandom.com/wiki/Evil_Reptilian#External_Traits_&_Abilities'>jumping and hunting</a> and the horns couldn't be covered anymore. </li>
		  <li>Pre-transformation Luchino has both lobes pierced, but can no longer wear ear jewelry post-transformation. He does pierce his own tongue sheath though.</li>
		  <li>Since Luchino was only reported missing, he's probably still alive and squatting in the non-occupied cabin in Darkwoods that Bane Perez used to rest in.</li>
		    <ul>
			  <li>This is my way of shoehorning him into AOM and making Luchino x Norton work. After Norton retreats from his assassination attempt in Darkwoods, he stays in hiding at the hunting cabin and <strike>gets assaulted</strike> meets Luchino there, the legend'd reptilian of Britain.</li>
			  <li>Yidhra also appears at the bonfire if you chair 3 survivors, so this conveniently (but barely) ties Luchino into this map for me.</li>
			</ul>
		  <li>Given that Luchino has the quadratojugal bone that allows reptiles, birds, and amphibians to dislocate their jaws, Luchino's teeth are exclusively for gripping and killing. He also can't chew given that he lost his molars, and instead swallows bodies whole.</li>
		    <ul>
		      <li>The range of large animals he can swallow whole are pigs, goats, and deers.</li>
		      <li>Luchino has trouble breathing while jumping around. When reaching the stage where his neck had transformed into a thicker trunk, he experimented a lot with the limits of what he can swallow resulting in laryngeal neuropathy. After jumping, he pants in <a href='https://youtube.com/shorts/vCdFTjDBDho?si=l8luvSFQD-dTHGEa' target='_blank'>the same way horses with this condition do</a>. These are the internal tradeoffs that come with &quot;evolution&quot;.</li>
		    </ul>
		  <li>Poor eyesight, but he develops odor receptors on his tongue within mid-stage metamorphosis and scent becomes his primary form of navigating the game stages.</li>
		  <li>Luchino developed an asymmetrical tine on his tongue and a tail that can't fall off but regenerates if ever cut.</li><li>Luchino has a cloaca. Mid-transformation, all the bits recede internally and it's not that different from a hairless marsupial's cloaca. I imagine your junk growing scales and turning inside out is terrifying to see though.</li>
		  <li>In his early-stage transformations, he develops a microscale film all over his body. They're so small that you can't see the individual scutes and too thin and soft to have yet developed his infamous teal color, but it gives him a glossy look.</li>
		    <ul>
		      <li>As this film becomes thicker towards the final stage of his metamorphosis, shedding becomes more painful. Like tearing a 2-4mm deep scab off your entire body. It's a bloody process, but natural.</li>
		    </ul>
		  <li>In the mid-late stages of his metamorphosis, his human hair completely sheds and is gradually replaced with a scalp of scale pillars, similar to the hairs on a gecko's feet or the &quot;hairs&quot; on a bug's exoskeleton.</li>
		</ul>
