	  <h4 id='whoIsLuchino'>&rarr; Who is Luchino?</h4>
	  <div>
	    <p>Luchino Diruse is a playable character from a Dead-By-Daylight style game called Identity V. He was introduced in Season 6 of the game's running time and just like how DBD is split into killer/survivor sides, Luchino has two playstyles in both IDV's hunter and survivor factions.</p><p>Luchino's fate is what happens when science guides itself into the fog without ethic. He worked as a herpetologist alongside a university prior to his arrival to <a href='https://id5.fandom.com/wiki/Oletus_Manor' target='_blank'>Oletus</a> and is recognized in group 6, denoted by his <a href='https://id5.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Letters' target='_blank'>third character letter</a>'s confirmed serial &quot;6-1-4&quot;. He was known to test reptile bites on himself as his field was venom logic and would experience his very own genetic metamorphosis when given captivity of an unknown lizard-snake species. Some might say this was doomed kismet, but Luchino himself would go on to describe this transformation as a gift, or the &quot;presents from his research&quot;.</p>

	  <h4>&rarr; His Personality</h4>
	  <div class='rightbox'>
		<p>He is described by <a href='https://id5.fandom.com/wiki/Novelist' target='_blank'>the writer of the Character Letters</a> to be &quot;curious, cautious, envious, melancholic.&quot; Luchino is intuitive, constantly searching for people's intentions with him before he makes decisions, but composes himself politely when he speaks unopposed to the idea of working with suspicious people when it means furthering his studies. While he can be blunt, precise, and practical-minded, he is humble and realistic, understanding the limit of his abilties.</p>
		<p>Luchino seems to embrace the final stages of his transformation. His <a href='https://id5.fandom.com/wiki/Curiosity_(Emote)' target='_blank'>Character Day emote</a> tributes to his past how he remembers working as an academic professor, literally laughing at his naiveté and others who are like his younger self. This emote also sort of reflects his dark humor. In his last Character Day letter, he expresses enlightment that he no longer cares to persevere in the name of his research. It's not that he doesn't care anymore, but accepts that not everything can be understood by a mere man, and takes conclusion to his research in one last diary at the manor. He begins pursuit of his spirituality as he realizes the (Lovecraftian) nonreality of Oletus.</p>
		<center class='quote'>&quot;And I finally understand that those researchers who regret failing to find the answer are laughable. After all, there was never a true 'answer' in this world.&quot;<br>- IDV's &quot;The Last Page of a Record&quot; (2023)</center>
		<p>His settling mutation has rendered him something self-pleasuring and aggressive towards other people. His humor and sadistic tendencies carry into his (non-canon) online interactions and event dialogues, as he expresses an interest in plant toxins, chasing prey (sort of like a dog...) and unethical experimentation. He is long separated from the professor he once was, but he seems happier than when he was human.</p>
