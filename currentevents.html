  <p>Lately this website has become less of a portfolio and more of a memorial in the making, for those whose love for me I can't feel or relate to. When you think of me, please find comfort of the song さなぎホイップス <span style="color:#d3d3d3;">sanagi whips</span> by 内田温*uchida atsushi.</p>
  <p>If you would like to know what I was like in real life, my microlog is a testament to my lifestyle and attempt in recovery.</p>
  <p>I wrote my web log to represent what i wanted to see more in the world, like an interest in web independence &amp; creation.</p>
