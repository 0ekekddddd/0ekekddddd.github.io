	  <h4>100 Questions For An <strike>Lolita</strike> Ouji (2025)</h4>
	  <div>
	    <p>Before blogdeath, this questionnaire came from a 2002 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021115175002/http://naha.cool.ne.jp/amauni/lolita100Q.htm">archived blogpost on wayback</a>. I copy pasted someone else's iteration of the original questionnaire below. It's been altered to address ouji.</p>
	    <ol> 
		  <li><b>Please tell us your screen name, date of birth, and origin.</b> Gristlepod, 2003, N/A Current US Resident.</li>
		  <li><b>What is your height, weight, clothing size, and shoe size? </b><br>I am 157cm tall. That's all I'll list...</li>
		  <li><b>What made you start doing <strike>Lolita</strike> Ouji fashion?</b><br>I actually got into the fashion after high school graduation. I was experimenting with my style as a late bloomer and enjoyed the cute androgyny of Ouji fashion.</li>
		  <li><b>What is your favorite Lolita genre?</b><br>I'm kind of an oldschool elitist! I've come to appreciate modern sweet lolita, but it'll never beat the luxurious, rich aura of a velvet oldschool coordinate.</li>
		  <li><b>Do you have any particular commitment to that genre, or your own definition of it?</b><br>I consider myself an oldschool ouji. Those drapey, melancholic fabrics, chunky boots, and experimental textures define my style for the most part.</li>
		  <li><b>Do you have your ears pierced? How many piercings?</b><br>I used to have both of my lobes pierced but they closed. I'm hoping to repierce them, and possibly punch a couple more lobe holes.</li>
		  <li><b>What is your favorite brand?</b><br>Atelier Boz. I have only a few pieces under the label but their pants were made for my body type. A second contender would be Alice and the Pirates of course.</li>
		  <li><b>What is your favorite outfit?</b><br> I don't have one.</li>
		  <li><b>How many lolita friends do you have?</b> 1 close friend! We were both friends before we got into fashion but I'm kind of a lonelita unless I count my SNS mutuals.</li>
		  <li><b>What was the best thing about doing Ouji?</b><br>My view on fashion completely changed. No piece quite felt personal like a carefully constructed slim-waist Miho Matsuda jacket or a thick cotton AATP jabot veiled in chains. Every piece is an extension of another artist that I can wear. I am probably someone's spitting image of a vampire aristocrat, and there's something endearing about such a feeling that I can't help but keep chasing.</li>
		  <li><b>On the contrary, what is the most disgusting thing?</b><br> Wearing so many layers to achieve the look while living in a humid zone.</li>
		  <li><b>What magazine(s) do you read?</b><br> In the age of the internet there's no need for magazines. That being said, I browse through my GLB magazines like any other well-behaved ouji.</li>
		  <li><b>Headdress group? Team Bonnet? Team Headbow? </b><br>Team Headdress! I don't wear them but if I did, I'd like to be able to show off my hair.</li>
		  <li><b>Do you have bloomers?</b><br> I don't. It's scandalous to wear your bloomers out like a pair of pants. How unheard of.</li>
		  <li><b>Do you tie your <strike>headdress</strike> hat in front? or are you on the team that ties it behind your head? </b><br> In front. It makes me look cuter.</li>
		  <li><b>Do you have a favourite music genre or band?</b><br> Day-one fan of eurobeat and donk/hardbass. I love Blackout Crew, Missile Chewbacca, DJ Hixxy... I have beyond 1 favorite.</li>
		  <li><b>What is your phone ringtone?</b><br>It's a chiptune I made of Alice Deejay's Better Off Alone.</li>
		  <li><b> Do you go to live [concerts/shows] in <strike>Lolita</strike> Ouji? </b><br>Depends. It doesn't really matter if the scene is "wrong" or "right" for wearing ouji, but rather if I feel like wearing it that day. I don't wear ouji to bars though, too much risk and bustle.</li>
		  <li><b>For those who go to lives, do you headbang?</b><br>Nope. Hairbangs over headbangs, my hair is vital to the coord.</li>
		  <li><b>What colors do you like?</b><br>Black is a given! Reds and Purples are my top secondaries.</li>
		  <li><b>What are your hobbies?</b><br> Coding, music production, creating props, and inline skating.</li>
		  <li><b>What is your favourite perfume?</b><br>Colognes give me headaches so I don't wear them. Lotion is good enough.</li>
		  <li><b>Is there anything you say “I’m careful about this” when it comes to <strike>Lolita</strike> Ouji?</b><br> The negative space between a pair of pants and socks. A large reason why some people's ouji coordinates look amateurish is because they might not know how to balance the space between the socks, the pants, and the skin inbetween. I also try to be careful about sweat.</li>
		  <li><b>Where do you usually hang out?</b><br> Walking around the city park and shopping. I often check Ebisu to see if they reloaded the capsule machines with Identity V merch, and Buckle to try on jeans I won't buy.</li>
		  <li><b>How many times a week do you wear <strike>Lolita</strike> Ouji?</b><br>On a weekly rate.</li>
		  <li><b>Please tell us the most embarrassing episode you had when you were a beginner in <strike>Lolita</strike> Ouji fashion.</b><br> Buying a Puvithel brooch.</li>
		  <li><b>What is your hairstyle and hair colour now?</b><br> My hair is naturally jet-black and I usually cut it into a layered heisei-revival vk cut inspired by Ryutaro from Plastic Tree, and style it as such. I often think about bleaching it and dying it a light brown.</li>
		  <li><b>How long have you been in <strike>Lolita</strike> Ouji? </b><br> Not very long, since 2021.</li>
		  <li><b>Do you have a dedicated <strike>Lolita</strike> Ouji storage space? </b><br> My closet is primarily comprised of the original Japanese ouji brands. Even when I reach for another style I still find ways to incorporate Baby and Putumayo into it. </li>
		  <li><b>Have you ever thought about leaving <strike>Lolita</strike> Ouji? If so, why?</b><br> I don't think ouji will ever leave <u>me</u>. The oldschool ouji look is so secondnature to me that I'm not even close to worried about leaving the fashion despite my lean towards cooler "glam" styles. I sincerely enjoy the clothing brands outside of the ouji phenomenon that created it.</li>
		  <li><b>What is your motto?</b><br> Live bold.</li>
		  <li><b>What are your dreams for the future?</b><br> To be able to fund my designer lifestyle as well as establish my art at conventions. I also want to live near trains and walkable cities.</li>
		  <li><b>“This person would definitely look good in Lolita!” Are there any celebrities you think that about?</b><br> I don't think about celebrities too often.</li>
		  <li><b>Please tell us the item with the most memories and those memories.</b><br> My frill-collar Jane Marple coat. My most cherished memory with it was wearing it to an Acryl Agitt pop-up. I've met Daisuke Ichikawa who was chief designer for h.Naoto up to the 2010's and I've since respected that moment and cherished the clothes I brought back home. I still use this coat for closet cosplays of Andrew Kreiss and its my staple piece for concert attendance.</li>
		  <li><b>What was the first item you got? </b><br>The <a href="https://lolibrary.org/items/btssb-sophia-blouse" target="_blank">BTSSB Sophia blouse</a> in black. I couldn't keep wearing it because the shirring irritated my arms, but the standing lace collar and rose buttons were my favorite details about it. A great first piece to own that I don't regret.</li>
		  <li><b>Do you have a signature pose for taking a picture?</b><br>I noticed in most of my pictures I like to kick my leg forward to show off my boots. The 3/4 face angle chin tilt is a classic too. If I'm feeling myself, I lift a draped hand over my stomach to frame my waist.</li>
		  <li><b>What is the “Bible” of your heart? (Like what Books, magazines, CDs, etc. represent your inner self)</b><br> Exile's Pro Agonist CD.</li>
		  <li><b>How many centimeters tall is the highest heel you have?</b><br>I don't wear heels, I wear platforms. I'd like to own a pair of <a href="https://lolibrary.org/items/atelier-pierrot-antique-gold-frame-pumps-2025">AtePie</a> &amp; <a href="https://lolibrary.org/items/aatp-little-devil-pumps-2024" target="_blank">AATP</a> pumps though.</li> 
		  <li><b>Have you ever worn a tiara?</b><br> Would I look cute with one?</li>
		  <li><b>Do you want to be a <strike>prince</strike> princess once in a while? What kind of <strike>prince</strike> princess?</b><br> I plan to wear oldschool lolita in the future. An <a href="https://lolibrary.org/items/btssb-rose-pattern-lace-doll-op" target="_blank">OP like this in the white colorway</a> would be euphoric to walk around in.</li>
		  <li><b>What kind of lace do you like?</b><br> Cotton torchon.</li>
		  <li><b>Do you own a (ball jointed) doll? Those who have them are usually so enthusiastic about them!</b><br> Nope.</li>
		  <li><b>What’s inside your lolita bag right now?</b><br> An <a href="https://lolibrary.org/items/btssb-usakumya-rucksack-mini-mini-2024-b48uk851">Usakumya Mini Mini</a>, spare stereo earbuds, and a rolled up Innocent World tote bag in case I don't have room in my bag to carry more things.</li>
		  <li><b>What is your favorite flower?</b><br> White mums and gardenias.</li>
		  <li><b>What is your favorite accessory right now?</b><br>My phone's alice auaa keystrap.</li>
		  <li><b>Please tell us your favorite / recommended cosmetics.</b><br> My entire makeup set is from Canmake. The BB serum cream does decent coverage without feeling thick.</li>
		  <li><b>Bright eyes are the hallmark of being a doll! So do you use false eyelashes?</b><br> I do not wear false eyelashes but I have before. Mascara is more comfortable.</li>
		  <li><b>What is your particular eye makeup style? </b><br> I'm not adept to makeup so I draw everything out with eyeshadow, highlighter, and a dream. I almost never use eyeliner.<center><img src="img/100questions/eye-makeup.png"></center></li>
		  <li><b>Is your lipstick red? Blue? black? pink?</b><br>I'm a chapstick wearer.</li>
		  <li><b>What color do you often use for nail polish?</b><br> Black or white.</li>
		  <li><b>Have you ever changed your clothes in the toilet at the train station? </b><br>Yes, at airports too.</li>
		  <li><b>Have you ever had twin lolita or triplet lolita? impression?</b><br> No. My style is too subdued and solid for the far sweeter local lolitas since I don't own print pieces.</li>
		  <li><b>What are you doing to keep in shape? Recommendations?</b><br> I do inline skating biweekly. There's no real answer to this, since I fit the Japanese-standard ouji figure solely on genetic luck.</li>
		  <li><b>Wearing ouji alone. Are you okay with it?</b><br> Of course I am, I barely even mind standing out. Most of the time I get compliments or people approach me first, which is the point as an introvert who hates initiating.</li>
		  <li><b>How much do you spend a month on ouji?</b><br>Below ¥14,000. My spending varies and I rarely get a new piece monthly. Most of my wardrobe is secondhand and I take pleasure bragging about my bargains. The only think I never invest cheap is jewelry and shoes though; a mass produced brooch can turn an elegant coord into a tacky costume.</li>
		  <li><b> Did you have any time lag between learning about Lolita fashion and actually doing it or resistance to starting?</b><br> I'd say there was about a 2 year lag.</li>
		  <li><b>What is the most expensive thing you have ever bought? (In relation to Ouji)</b><br><a href="https://lolibrary.org/items/aatp-cheshire-cats-parachute-shirt">AATP's Cheshire Cat's Parachute Shirt</a> in black colorway is the first piece I paid full price for. I'd love to find the rest of the set.</li>
		  <li><b>Ouji really costs money, doesn’t it? How do you pay for it?</b><br> Commission work, selling original merchandise. I'm trying to get a part-time/full-time job but the market is completely dead no matter how much I try. Shrug.</li>
		  <li><b>How much is the total cost you have spent so far?</b><br> At least $1k and counting! I'll keep buying Ouji for as long as I want.</li>
		  <li><b>Is there a store you would like to see nearby?</b><br> A ClosetChild store would make lifestyling easier, but there probably wouldn't be enough people who wear lolita or j-gothic to support the kind of clothes they carry. My second choice would be BTSSB.</li>
		  <li><b>Just between us, is there a store that makes you say: ‘that’s a rip-off!’?</b><br> Anything Bodyline is a joke, I can't believe people are reselling it for $70+ just because of its "archive worth". You can get a higher quality blouse from BTSSB with that price?</li>
		  <li><b>Have you ever used an online shop? If you have, please give us some advice on the good points and bad points. If you haven’t, tell us why not.</b><br> Online shopping is primarily how I build my wardrobe. My favorite storepages are Closetchild and Mercari. Look into shopping proxy sites such as Buyee or Zenmarket; the most common issue with shipping internationally is sending out your pieces one by one for $30USD per parcel. What shipping proxies do is hold your stuff at a warehouse then consolidate your parcels into one cheaper package. I usually save warehouse space for accessories like ties and can badges.</li>
		  <li><b>What’s an indie brand that makes you go “this is exactly my style”. </b><br> As far as I'm concerned all lolita brands are indie. My dream accessory would be a Suppurate System eyepatch or rose resin necklace. The only thing I'm worried about is the quality because some blogs have claimed that the signature Fruits Nails Necklace is plastic instead of metal due to the materials being repurposed art, so I could probably make my own accessories but sturdier.</li>
		  <li><b>Absolutely out of reach! But I want it! Do you have any brands or products like that for you?</b><br>Basic answer... the Atelier Boz Roland Jacket and VW rocking horse sandal shoes.</li>
		  <li><b>What do you do with your tired old clothes?</b><br>I sell them on Lacemarket or Mercari.</li>
		  <li><b>What was the most recent ouji and non ouji item of clothing you bought?</b><br>This week my last ouji related purchase was a pair of long aristocrat pants from Black Peace Now and my last non-ouji related purchase was a jean yukata set from Vanquish.</li>
		  <li><b>What is something you missed out on that you’ll never see again, but you can’t forget?</b><br> I regret missing this one swapmeet because of a group of alcoholic cosplayers. We didn't even make it to the masquerade that I ditched the swapmeet for.</li>
		  <li><b>What do you think of people that wear lolita only to lives/concerts</b><br>If they want to, then they're free to. I think they might be missing out on the thrill of dressing out in EGL for park walks and markets.</li>
		  <li><b>What do you think of No-Makeup-Lolita?</b><br>I personally think makeup (even if it's just a little foundation) is just as important as hairstyling. Lolita is most importantly an art with a look to it, and every element of the wearer should be cohesive with some elbow grease, as most fashions are. But you know it's no skin off my back if someone looks slightly bare.</li>
		  <li><b>You suddenly meet another person totally wearing Ouji/Lolita! What do you do?</b><br>I would ask them about their coordinate! I am a little shy.</li>
		  <li><b>How old is an Ouji allowed to be?</b><br>Age limitations are arbitrary if you look and feel cute.</li>
		  <li><b> Under what conditions do you think Ouji should graduate?</b><br>When it's not a style they like anymore.</li>
		  <li><b>Stop this! Are there any things no one should do in Ouji?</b><br>"Clown ouji" is not a real substyle (not to be confused with and ouji coordinate with circus/clown motifs). A lot of people miss the essence of what ouji actually looks like and that the fashion is built on this very look. It's a luxury street fashion, do you really think a cheap clown costume and some tights is going to cut it for Ouji?</li>
		  <li><b>Do you have a specific sense of what a perfect ouji should be?</b><br>The perfect ouji just has a compatible sense for modern japanese styling, and ouji aesthetic.</li>
		  <li><b>Other than what you said for 73, what is something you wish people wouldn’t do?</b><br>People, especially in-community EGL wearers, should stop caring about what individual members are doing because its a waste of time. Focus on what your community can do for you to help you embrace your ideal style.</li>
		  <li><b>What do you think about Lolita fashion for men?</b><br>It doesn't matter what your gender is as long as you share a fond appreciation for rich femininity like the rest of us. You could even say <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mana_(Japanese_musician)">some men</a> helped pioneer a love for lolita fashion?</li>
		  <li><b>Have you changed in any way since you started ouji?</b><br>My tastes have gotten richer, I appreciate complex construction and natural fabrics/leathers more than I did before.</li>
		  <li><b> What do the people around you say about you wearing ouji? Do you accept it?</b><br>Most people are accepting. I've accepted the strange looks that strangers give me because I know I look good.</li>
		  <li><b>What kind of ouji fashion do you do in the hot summer months? </b><br>I don't really have a choice outside of casual; short-sleeve blouses with matching wristcuffs and any selection of brand pants. I also own a BTSSB parasol. Putumayo blouses/cutsews are my go-to because most articles are jersey fabrics and thin cottons for daily wear.</li>
		  <li><b>Do you go to school or work in Lolita?</b><br>Nope.</li>
		  <li><b>What is your usual outfit style?</b><br>Visual gyaruo, street, aristo.</li>
		  <li><b>Do you have any objections to second-hand goods? </b><br>As long as its in good condition and one piece (so to speak), I won't ever turn away a completely good piece.</li>
		  <li><b>Do you have a partner? Do they understand?</b><br>A mori girlfriend who wants to get into lolita to match with me. You usually hear it the other way around.</li>
		  <li><b>Please tell us your ideal male image.</b><br>The best kind of male is one comfortable enough to participate in genderless fashion to look the way he wants. Gyaru and EGA aren't exactly paragons of masculine image, so you have to be ready to bend the means of what masculinity looks like in you.</li>
		  <li><b>What kind of person is the ouji who left the biggest impression on you?</b><br>My ouji idol is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/byakuya_a?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==" target="_blank">Asagiri</a> and she definitely looks great in both ouji and lolita.</li>
		  <li><b>Have you ever made your own clothes? What kind of clothes is it?</b><br>I've sewn a button-up for cosplay before but nothing aristo-grade. Sometimes I'll repurpose old clothes by cutting up their graphics and sewing it onto my bags or Converse shoes.</li>
		  <li><b>Have you ever made an accessory yourself? What did you make?</b><br>I've made a few carousel kandi cuffs. For some reason I'm embarrassed to include this in the questionnaire.</li>
		  <li><b>This thing I made was a great success! Is there anything you feel that way about? </b><br>I feel this way about most of my artworks, website layouts, and computer projects. I'm a designer in many other senses of the word outside of fashion.</li>
		  <li><b>Tell us if you have an ideal Ouji outfit or coordination.</b><br>My ideal ouji coord is made of solid colors or resonant jacquard or velvet textures, accented with torchon laces. The pants and socks should be long enough to only leave a window strip of my skin. Gunmetal looks the best on me so I always wear my Vivienne Westwood silver bas necklace. I'm loyal to the gothic look.</li>
		  <li><b>Is there anyone you admire? What kind of person are they?</b><br><a href="https://www.instagram.com/hi_deomi.jp/" target="_blank">Hideomi</a> has an undefeated playful aura that I want to match someday.</li>
		  <li><b>You can date any person for just one day. The other person will also dress however you want. Who is it and what kind of date?</b><br>I'm loyal to only one person. My girlfriend and I will have a tea party out in the city park on a winter day. Well actually I'm not a tea person, so actually I'll be drinking hazelnut coffee to wash down my cake. For the occasion, I'll dabble a little in sweet ouji and she will wear a red x white old school lolita coord.</li>
		  <li><b>What kind of store would you like to have if you were to open one in the future?</b><br>I would look into leather &amp; j-Gothic retail. I specifically want to stock crocodile belts, New Rock platforms, and Sex Pot Revenge. Maybe I'd even sell my own clothing designs and have my own screenprinting tech.</li>
		  <li><b>When looking at ouji, your eyes will go straight to this motif. What is it?</b><br>Wings and gunmetal crowns.</li>
		  <li><b>Do you want your child to be an Ouji too? </b><br>I'd like to be able to pass my wardrobe down to someone if I did. Otherwise I'm burning my clothes with me.</li>
		  <li><b>How much can I spend on one ouji outfit?</b><br>A large budget doesn't always make you good at coordinating, but it definitely helps fill out space. When buying pieces, you should think about how versatile something is and how many times you can coordinate it. If you're willing to wear something longterm, you should invest in it and never replace it.</li>
		  <li><b>This is quintessentially ouji! Is there a certain gesture that makes you think this.</b><br>Buying a pair of pants from your favorite gothic brand online (Black Peace Now, Atelier Boz) and when they arrive in the mail, the waist is too small on you.</li>
		  <li><b>I want to wear that once in my life! Do you ever think that about any style other than ouji?</b><br>Shironuri decora with Hamtaro motifs.</li>
		  <li><b>Looking at your ouji collection or style, what one word would you use to sum it up?</b><br>Romantic.</li>
		  <li><b>What is your ideal ouji image?</b><br>I'm probably a bouncing scale between trying to look like moe Ryuk and a playful vampire.</li>
		  <li><b>Thank you very much! Please give us your impression of answering 100! </b><br> This gave me a good idea about what other lolitas &amp; oujis might want to learn about me. Hope some of these questions can help my readers understand my ouji values.</li>
